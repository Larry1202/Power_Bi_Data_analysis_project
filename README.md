# Power_Bi_Data_analysis_project

This project was made to showskill my ability to analyse and visualize the data in a more Professional and Interactive way.

This project is made by importing the openly available Global Sales excel sheet data of the year 2012 till 2015.
My main focus of this project was to analyse the imported data, perform the required data cleaning and arrangement procedures, and also my final goal was to visualize the relations between various datas and also to make it more interactable, so that it can be easier to visualize the data with some appealing interactions between them.
